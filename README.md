## Input
Input is the way the computer gets information from the user

note: Python initially treats imput as a `string` type

Ex.

5 --> "5"

Today is Monday --> "Today is Monday"

### Formula:
`variableName = input("PROMPT")`

PROMPT - A question or statement that the computer asks the user

Python stores the __input__ in the __variableName__
